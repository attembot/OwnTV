/**
 * Drives **MultiView** — up to [MAX] live streams on screen at once (PR 2, building on the PiP engine).
 *
 * Architecture: OwnTV's live full-screen player is ExoPlayer, so MultiView is simply **N ExoPlayer tiles**.
 * Each tile is a [tv.own.owntv.player.SecondaryLivePlayer] — the same constrained second decoder hardened
 * for PiP (a resolution-cap hint, stereo, no subtitles, software-decoder fallback, no audio focus), which is
 * exactly what running several concurrent decoders on TV hardware needs. The cap is smaller than a PiP corner
 * (a quarter-screen tile never needs 720p); it picks a lower rendition for adaptive streams (no transcoding),
 * and for single-resolution streams the safeguard is the software-decoder fallback — so on a weak SoC four
 * full-res streams lean on CPU rather than failing. Concurrent-decoder limits are real; tile count may need
 * to be device-tiered (like [tv.own.owntv.player.PlayerBudget]) in a follow-up.
 *
 * Only the **active** tile is audible (audio follows D-pad focus — two soundtracks would be cacophony) and,
 * in [MultiLayout.DOMINANT], the active tile is the large one. The engine pool is created lazily and reused
 * across sessions; [exit] stops every decoder so MultiView never holds streams open in the background.
 *
 * Pure state + thin engine calls, so the whole thing is unit-testable with fake [CornerEngine]s — no real
 * decoder is ever spun up in a test.
